  name: "James"
  surname: "Graham"
  bio: |
   James Graham is a software engineer who deeply enjoys starting and building businesses from scratch. He received a Thiel Fellowship last year for his work on Caffei.net, which is the fastest way to establish a TLS connection between iOS and your api (your commerce app can make a lot more money by becoming way faster!). Used by the largest freelancer marketplace, a large-Boston based travel company, and other commerce companies around the world, Caffeine improves security by making PFS and certificate pinning automatic and free, among others.

   Recently he has become interested in empowering and better tooling the "small guys" that all SaaS has so far ignored: senior citizens, immigrants, and people who Just Don't Know by starting the Wallace Murry Phone Co. Wallace Murry is the only wireless phone provider based in MA. Wallace Murry doesn't sell your data to advertisers like AT&T et al, puts on events/sessions at low-income community centers that promote digital literacy (how to use a mouse, keyboard, email, google maps, etc), won't sell you an unlimited data plan if you don't need it, and is staffed with people from your local community who pick up the phone instantly if you call with any questions related to your phone (or beyond!).
