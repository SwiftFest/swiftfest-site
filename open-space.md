#### What are 'Open Spaces'?

Open Spaces are an **"unconferencey"** way to have small group conversations on topics that are most relevant to our community at just the right time. You submit [topics](http://bit.ly/openswift2018) that you want to discuss in a group setting, then before the event, these topics are grouped into categories that help people self-organize into right-fit groups.

#### Location and Timing

We will be meeting in the upstairs dining hall space of the [Calderwood Pavilion](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Calderwood+Pavilion+(at+the+Boston+Center+for+the+Arts+-+BCA)/@42.344525,-71.0730557,17z/) (where **SwiftFest Boston** is held) from _5-7pm_ on _Tuesday, June 28th_. 

#### What Will We Discuss?

Because this open spaces event is the last workshop session of [SwiftFest Boston 2018](http://www.swiftfest.io/), it's likely that topics will gravitate towards technically-focused iOS development, testing, operations, and team management.

However, a key affinity of the open spaces approach is to let the community figure out what matters most right now, and there’s a lot going on in the broader tech scene in Boston today, like DevOps leadership, sustainable startup practices, effective technical recruitment, municipal transportation, and infrastructure support, etc. You never know, and that’s the fun part!

#### What to Bring

**Yourself**, but…
